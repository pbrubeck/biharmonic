\section{Numerical examples}
In this section, we present contour plots for the stream function $\psi$ superimposed on a colorplor of the velocity magnitude. We use black contours for the first eddy and the subsequent ones are highlighted in yellow. The convergence plots indicate root-exponential convergence as expected. We also provide a close up of the eddies. We choose various popular sample problems found in the literature for testing the Lighting Stokes Solver.

For comparison, Ronquist, in \cite[Fig.~12]{Ronquist88}, solved the same problem with the spectral element method with $E=30$ and polynomial degree $N=8$, and no special treatment for the corners. which gives $\sqrt{\text{DoFs}}\approx 126$. The first two eddies have been observed experimentally by Taneda in \cite[Fig.~19]{Taneda79}, also included in \cite[Fig.~10]{VanDyke82}, for a very similar setup driven by a rotating cylinder with $\text{Re}=1.7\times10^{-1}$.}

\subsection{Multiply connected domains}


The analytical solution for the flow past a cylinder of radius $R$ at a distance $d$ from an infinite wall was given by Wannier in \cite{Wannier50}
\begin{equation}
\psi = (A + Fy)\log \frac{x^2 + (s+y)^2}{x^2 + (s-y)^2} + B \frac{y(s+y)}{x^2 + (s+y)^2} + C \frac{y(s-y)}{x^2+(s-y)^2} + Dy + E\left(x^2+y^2+s^2\right).
\end{equation}
where $s^2=d^2-R^2$, and $A,B,C,D,E,F$ are constants to be determined.
