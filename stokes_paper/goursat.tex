\section{Biharmonic functions in simply-connected domains}

\begin{theorem}[Goursat representation]
\label{th:goursat}
Let $\Omega\subseteq\mathbb{C}$ be a simply-connected open region, and let $\psi : \Omega \to \reals$ be a biharmonic function. That is,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:bih}
\nabla^4 \psi = \nabla^2 \left(\nabla^2 \psi\right) = \psi_{xxxx} +2 \psi_{xxyy} + \psi_{yyyy}= 0 \quad \text{in } \Omega.
\end{equation}
Then one can represent $\psi$ in terms of functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ analytic in $\Omega$ in what is known as the Goursat representation,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:goursat}
\psi(x,y) = \psi(z,\conj{z}) = \Im \left\{ \conj{z}f(z) + g(z)\right\}.
\end{equation}
The functions $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are uniquely defined up to addition of arbitrary terms $\lambda z+C$ to $f(z)$ and $\conj{C}z+\alpha$ to $g(z)$, where $\lambda,\alpha\in\reals$ and $C\in\mathbb{C}$.
\end{theorem}
The use of the imaginary as opposed to the real part is merely to simplify the expressions for physical quantities associated with $\psi$. Series expansions based on \eqref{eq:goursat} have been used to find numerical solutions to BVPs associated with \eqref{eq:bih} by Gaskell et al. in \cite{Gaskell98}, Finn, Cox and Byrne in \cite{FinnCoxByrne03}, and by Luca and Crowdy in \cite{Luca18}, among many others. The first proof to Theorem \ref{th:goursat} was given by Goursat in \cite{Gou98}, and an alternative proof is given by Muskhelishvili in \cite{Mus19}, which is also found in textbooks such as \cite{ckp66} and \cite{Mus77}.

\begin{proof}[Goursat's proof \cite{Gou98}]
First, we use the well-known property that $\psi$ is analytic in $\Omega$ with respect to the real variables $x,y$, and note that the biharmonic operator can be written in terms of Wirtinger derivatives,
\begin{equation}
\nabla^4 \psi = 16\frac{\partial^4 \psi}{\partial\conj{z}^2 \partial z^2}.
\end{equation}
Treating $z$ and $\conj{z}$ as independent variables, one can solve this by separation of variables. Since $\psi$ is analytic, we may plug in the ansatz $\psi_k = A_k(z)B_k(\conj{z})$, obtaining
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial^4 \psi_k}{\partial\conj{z}^2 \partial z^2} = A_k''(z) B_k''(\conj{z}) = 0,
\end{equation} 
which implies that either $A_k''(z)=0$ or $B_k''(\conj{z})=0$. The solution spaces for these two subproblems are spanned by $\{1,z\}$ for $A_k''(z)=0$  and $\{1,\conj{z}\}$ for $B_k''(\conj{z})=0$. Therefore, without loss of generality, the solution is given by superposition of the four independent solutions
\begin{equation}
\psi(z,\conj{z}) =  A_1(z) + \conj{z} A_2(z) + B_3(\conj{z}) + z B_4(\conj{z}),
\end{equation}
where $A_1(z), A_2(z), B_3(\conj{z}), B_4(\conj{z})$ are arbitrary functions. Since $\psi$ must be real, $\psi=\conj{\psi}$ implies that 
\begin{equation}
\psi(z,\conj{z}) =  A_1(z)  + \conj{z} A_2(z)  + \conj{A_1(z)} + z \conj{A_2(z)} = 2 \Re\left\{A_1(z) + \conj{z} A_2(z)\right\},
\end{equation}
which implies \eqref{eq:goursat} by letting $f(z) = -2i A_2(z)$ and $g(z) = -2i A_1(z)$. We finally note that, when $\psi$ is given, $f(z)$ and $g(z)$ are determined up to an additive linear term. To be more precise, the substitutions $f(z)\to f(z)+\lambda z + C$ together with $g(z)\to g(z)+\conj{C}z+\alpha$ for $\lambda,\alpha\in\reals$ and $C\in\mathbb{C}$ leave $\psi$ invariant.
\end{proof}


\begin{proof}[Muskhelishvili's proof \cite{Mus19}]
If $\omega=-\nabla^2 \psi$, then $-\nabla^2\omega = \nabla^4\psi = 0$. Now define $p$ as the harmonic conjugate of $\omega$, satisfying the Cauchy-Riemann conditions
\begin{equation}
\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial x} = \frac{\partial p}{\partial y}, \quad
\frac{\partial\omega}{\partial y} = -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x};
\end{equation}
this function is determined up to an arbitrary constant term, $p_0\in\reals$. Then the expression
\begin{equation}
h(z) = p(x,y)-i\omega(x,y)
\end{equation}
represents a function of the complex variable $z=x+iy$, analytic in $\Omega$. Furthermore, put
\begin{equation}
f(z) := \frac{1}{4} \int_a^z h(w) dw = f_1 + if_2,
\end{equation}
where $a\in\Omega$ is arbitrary, causing $f(z)$ to be defined up to a term $\lambda z +C$ where $4\lambda=p_0$ and $C\in\mathbb{C}$.
Obviously,
\begin{equation}\label{eq:fprime}
f'(z) = \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial x} + i \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} = -i \frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y} + \frac{\partial f_2}{\partial y} = \frac{1}{4} \left(p-i\omega\right),
\end{equation}
and from the imaginary part of \eqref{eq:fprime}, we may write
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2\left(y f_1\right) = 2\frac{\partial f_1}{\partial y} = \frac{\omega}{2},\quad \nabla^2\left(x f_2\right) = 2\frac{\partial f_2}{\partial x} = -\frac{\omega}{2}.
\end{equation}
Thus, the function $\psi + yf_1 - xf_2$ is harmonic, i.e.
\begin{equation}
\nabla^2 \left(\psi + yf_1 - xf_2\right) = -\omega + \frac{\omega}{2} + \frac{\omega}{2} =0.
\end{equation}
Let this function be $\psi + yf_1 - xf_2 = \Im\left\{g(z)\right\}$, where $g(z)$ is analytic, and for the given $f(z)$, it will be defined up to a term $\conj{C}z+\alpha$, where $\alpha\in\reals$, since $\psi$ must not depend on the term $C\conj{z}$. Hence one can represent
\begin{equation}
\psi = \Im\left\{\conj{z}f(z) + g(z)\right\}.
\end{equation}
This argument can be used to establish the analyticity of $\psi$.
\end{proof}
