\section{Examples \label{sec:results}}
In this section, the lightning Stokes solver is tested on various sample problems found in the literature. We present contour plots for the stream function $\psi$ superimposed on a color plot of the velocity magnitude. We use black contours for the first Moffatt eddy, and subsequent ones are highlighted in yellow. The convergence plots indicate root-exponential convergence as expected. We also provide a close-up of the eddies.

For comparison, the first two eddies have been observed experimentally by Taneda in \cite[Fig.~19]{taneda79}, also included in \cite[Fig.~10]{vandyke82}, for a very similar setup driven by a rotating cylinder with $\text{Re}=1.7\times10^{-1}$.}
