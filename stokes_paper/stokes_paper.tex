\begin{abstract}
Gopal and Trefethen have recently introduced ``lightning solvers''
for the 2D Laplace and Helmholtz equations, based on rational
functions with poles exponentially clustered near singular corners.
Making use of the Goursat representation in terms of analytic
functions, we extend these methods to the biharmonic equation,
specifically to 2D Stokes flow.  Flows in bounded, unbounded, and
multiply connected domains are considered, with solutions computed
to ten digits of accuracy in a few seconds of laptop time.  As an
illustration of the high accuracy, we readily resolve two or three
counter-rotating Moffatt eddies near a singular corner.
